## Introduction

> ***Note:*** _This lab should be completed in small groups of 2-3._

This lab will help you gain more practice with searching.

## Exercise

### Whiteboard Practice
You are given 3 things to sort. Write your solutions on a whiteboard, showing the steps for each search. Take photos of the answers. For example,

> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10

To find the number 7, the steps are:

```
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
6, 7, 8, 9, 10
6, 7, 8
7
```

> 3, 5, 6, 8, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17, 18 || Find 16

> 1, 4, 6, 7, 12, 13, 15, 18, 19, 20, 22, 24 || Find 20

> -22, 7, 33, 12, 0, 0, -9, 66, 94, 103, 34, 54, 12, 54, 80, 90, 2 || Find 34

**Bonus:**

With the following set, show the steps of the binary search as well as the sorting beforehand. Sort in any way you feel is best:

> 94, 103, 34, 54, 12, 54, 80, 90, 2 || Find 80

**Bonus #2**

In either pseudocode or java, write the algorithm for binary search *recursively*. Take a pic of it, or save it in a file.
